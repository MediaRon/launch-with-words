Launch With Words is a product that combines the experience of a small business copywriter with blogging prompts to encourage you to publish a blog post once a month.

<h3>I Built the Site. Why Does Copywriting Matter?</h3>

In an ideal world, WordPress developers pair with professional copywriters to launch a site with blog posts, not just page content. If budget allows, this creates the best experience for the launch, SEO, and for payment. Unfortunately, many times the client is fearful of writing. You end up at a standstill. That's frustrating for you both.

As WordPress professionals, we know clients should use their sites and publish regularly. This gives them an appreciation of the tool you just built. A client who appreciates the site, uses it. In their eyes the website "works" and the cycle repeats.

The goal of this plugin is to help the client with copywriting. It encourages them to publish once a month so their website and generates leads. The website you use is one that works. 

You've worked hard to launch their site with words, so why not continue that habit?

<a href="https://bridgetwillard.com/downloads/launch-with-words-starter-content-pack/">Launch with Words</a> installs a year's worth of blog post prompts -- as drafts -- to encourage your clients to write and guides them in blogging best practices. Just say no to placeholder or faker text. Why install databases you just have to delete later?

These prompts are based upon the small business ebook, "If You Don't Mind Your Business, Who Will?" from established copywriter, Bridget Willard.
