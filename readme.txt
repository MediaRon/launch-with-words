<h3>Do I Need Anything Else?</h3>

Yes. Launch With Words is a JSON importer. Head over to <a href="https://bridgetwillard.com/downloads/launch-with-words-starter-content-pack/">the Starter Content Pack</a> to grab that JSON file.

Launch With Words installs this JSON file. It is a year's worth of blog post prompts -- as drafts -- to encourage your clients to write and guides them in blogging best practices. Just say no to lorem i-sum, or placeholder text in the blogs. Hello World? No thanks. 

These prompts are based upon the small business ebook, "If You Don't Mind Your Business, Who Will?" from established copywriter, Bridget Willard.
